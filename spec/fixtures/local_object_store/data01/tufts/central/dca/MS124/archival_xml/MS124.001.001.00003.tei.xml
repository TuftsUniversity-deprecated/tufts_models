	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_11" n="11" end="timepoint_12">
	  <u who="ED">About '54 to about '66 or so. Now, I say '66, it may have closed even before then, I'm not sure. </u>

	  <u who="ED">Sometime '63, sixty-, '64, '65, '66, I'm not sure exactly when the theatre closed.</u>

	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_13" n="13" end="timepoint_14">
	  <u who="ED">Once I got into, into high school, we didn't go that often, but from nin-, about 1954 onwards, yup, 'til it closed, yeah, in the mid sixties.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_14" n="14" end="timepoint_15">
	  <u who="KM">How old were you in 1954?</u>
	  <u who="ED">Oh God I was, uhhh, six, six, six or seven. Yeah, six most of the year, we started, uh, I would go with the, the older kids, we'd always would go with the older kids when I was that young <unclear>again</unclear>.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_15" n="15" end="timepoint_16">
	  <u who="ED">Which is why I got in so much trouble when they had that bicycle contest that no one else wanted to go and I went, they had to send the older kids up to get me in order to be there, so, they didn't appreciate that much.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_16" n="16" end="timepoint_17">
	  <u who="KM">Yeah, I remember that, that's great. And where did you actually live in...?</u>
	  <u who="ED">On Central Street, I would, and, we lived, uh, let's see, 1-2-3-4-5, five or six blocks away on Central Street down towards Somerville Avenue.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_17" n="17" end="timepoint_18">
	  <u who="ED">It was definitely the nearest theater, it was the neighborhood theater, 'cause it's the nearest theatre to our house, yeah.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_18" n="18" end="timepoint_19">
	  <u who="KM">Mmm-hmm. Right, um, with, then I want to ask you just a little bit, if you could tell me again what, what the neighborhood was like, what time ah, what kind of families lived there....</u>
	  <u who="ED">Sure, well, the most important thing about the neighborhood to remember was then, was people lived there like for years and years.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_19" n="19" end="timepoint_20">
	  <u who="ED">There was very little mobility. People had lived there for a generation or two, you know and, and um, um, my whole childhood growing up in the neighborhood, I can only remember one or two families that moved in or moved out over that time, which is very very different, from, from now, when families move in every year, you know</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_20" n="20" end="timepoint_21">
	  <u who="ED">So there was a very cohe-, sense of, strong sense of coherence, identity, neighborhood identity, and continuity, all through my childhood.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_21" n="21" end="timepoint_22">
	  <u who="ED">The same people at the beginning were there at the end except for one or two people, you know? And, so that, is I think one big difference, I, I don't think there's that same coherence or, or continuity now that there was then.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_22" n="22" end="timepoint_23">
	  <u who="ED">Another thing that was very different about the neighborhood then, that is so different now, I notice it now because I, I live in the same neighborhood, now. Is that ah, uh, you couldn't drive down a street without having to wait for all the kids who were playing on the street to get off the street, ok. Now, there are no kids playing on the street, like there's none of that, it's very different, there was, we were in the middle of the baby boom, so every family had two or three or four or five kids in it. And they all belonged to different groups in the same neighborhood by age, but everyone was out playing on the street or in the schoolyard. </u>
	  <u who="KM">Right.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_23" n="23" end="timepoint_24">
	  <u who="ED">Ok, you don't see that anymore, everyone is involved in organized, individual activities now. The only organized activity we had then was that their was, uh maybe Little League, only, and only a couple kids were in that. </u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_24" n="24" end="timepoint_25">
	  <u who="ED">We would go to the Y, but we'd go as a group to the Y. Because the YMCA was, a couple, only a couple buildings, and still is a couple buildings down from where the theater was.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_25" n="25" end="timepoint_26">
	  <u who="ED">Otherwise, we were all a group, and we all played in the street or in the schoolyard, and, uh it went on for, the, the group stayed together for my whole childhood and early adole-, and adolescence. </u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_26" n="26" end="timepoint_27">
	  <u who="ED">We were mostly a, a second generation immigrant neighboorhood, I would say, forty percent Irish, forty percent Italian, and um, a few Portuguese descendents, and a few uh, Canadian descendents. </u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_27" n="27" end="timepoint_28">
	  <u who="ED">So, our parents weren't Italian and Irish immigrants, although some were, mostly it was our grandparents who had immigrated, because when we were born, immigration in the United States had been pretty much closed since the '20s. So, it was our parents' parents who had, but we still all maintained very strong ethnic identities, </u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_28" n="28" end="timepoint_29">
	  <u who="ED">The Irish kids in our neighborhood, very strong Irish ethnic background, and the Italians, very strong Italian, Italo-American cultural traditions that we all maintained. And um, I don't know, is that sort of like an answer to you....</u>
	  <u who="KM">Yeah, yeah,</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_29" n="29" end="timepoint_30">
	  <u who="KM">yeah, that's good.</u>
	  <u who="ED">So um, we were very aware of our ethnic backgrounds, but we weren't first generation immigrants ourselves, or our parents we-, our grandparents were mostly the immigrants from either Ireland or Italy.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_30" n="30" end="timepoint_31">
	  <u who="KM">Ok. I know, I was just...</u>
	  <u who="ED">It was mostly a blue collar....</u>
	  <u who="KM">Blue collar, yeah.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_31" n="31" end="timepoint_32">
	  <u who="ED">My, my father was a doctor, and he was on the staff of the Central hospital, which was only a block away from us. Central hospital was halfway between us and the central theater, or more close, closer to us, which is where I was born and most of the people in my neighborhood were born right in that hospital, right in the, right in the neighborhood. My father delivered most of the people in the neighborhood, there was mostly, aside from my father, I think it was a ninety-five percent, ninety-nine percent blue collar neighborhood.</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_32" n="32" end="timepoint_33">
	  <u who="KM">Yeah. Are there any aspects of the, maybe at the social structure the, of the neighborhood that you can think of, that contributed to, to the general movie go-, movie going experience at the Central?</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_33" n="33" end="timepoint_34">
	  <u who="KM">I know this is sort of a, a tough question, but, I just, when just talking to other people, the fact that it was working class, there weren't, this is just an example, there weren't very many cars, so that's why a lot of people went to, to the Central Theater, or also, it was, um, there's a lot of families living there, so, it was a very f-, I, I've noticed that it is a family oriented movie theater. Is there anything along those lines that you could sorta see?</u>
	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_34" n="34" end="timepoint_35">
	  <u who="ED">Well, we, I don't think I ever went to the Central Theater with my parents, we always went with our age group of kids. </u>

	  <u who="ED">And it would be in Boston, my Mother used to take me to the, the, the big fancy movie theaters in Boston, and back then the theaters in Boston were huge movie palaces, really, really, elaborate things, and so that was a big social occasion.

	  <u who="ED">Uh, that's very different today. Because we didn't participate in organized activities, like going to soccer team, going to dancing classes, going to music classes, because we didn't do those sorts of things, uh, we, would, I guess, go to the theater as a group, in lieu of some of those organized activities. </u>

	  <u who="ED">I mean, some of us had dancing, some of like my sister went to dancing school, if you did anything you'd go to little league or go to dancing school, or some. But they were very few organized after-school activities at all. </u>

	  <u who="ED">And ah, and the Central Theater, going to the theater was not an evening thing with the family during the week. It was a Saturday thing, definitely a Saturday thing. As I grew older into my adolescence, and started dating, if you were going on a Friday night date, the Central Theater, you know you'd go to the, either the Somerville, or into Boston, 'cause you wanted to do something classier than go to the local neighborhood theater.

	  <u who="ED">And, there used to be a submarine sandwich shop that I used to go to too, right in the same, right next to the theater, there, and, that was pretty cool but I don't think that came until the '60s, early '60s. </u>

	  <u who="ED">You had to go in the lobby, buy your ticket in the lobby, and right across from the ticket counter was the uh, um, concession stand, but what we did do as I said before was, like, sort of take cups from inside the soda machine that was right there, that was a trick we learned from the older kids and, we did that for awhile, something that got us into trouble a couple times, yeah.</u>
