	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_7" n="7" end="timepoint_8">
	  <u who="BH">But, grew up in the, in the Hillside here, went to the Hillside school, which is only two stone's throws from wh-, where we're sitting now...</u>
	  <u who="C">Yeah.</u>
	  <u who="BH">And I discovered today in a kind of a, tour of some of my roots, by car, the school appears to be closed.</u>

	  <u who="C">Oh really?</u>

	</u>
	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_12" n="12" end="timepoint_13">
	  <u who="BH">And so, so we grew up in, in Medford Hillside, there used to be a bank there, there is where, three grocery stores, the hardware store and a <gap desc="inaudible"/> but there never was a movie, never was a local movie place in Medford Hillside.</u>

	  <u who="BH">Well...probably there was no no no space for it, and maybe they figured that, the market was sufficient so that people could go in Medford to Medford Square, there's a couple of theaters, or, or, to nearby Somerville where we are now, west Somerville, and Ball Square.</u>

	  <u who="BH">And, and, so, I guess f-, for, for many reasons, 'cause there were a lot of residences here on Boston Avenue...'cause they, they, for some, they just wasn't, they had a railroad station and they had activity, uh, right, right there, but uh, there wasn't uh, there wasn't a movies, so we, we gravitated a little distance.</u>
