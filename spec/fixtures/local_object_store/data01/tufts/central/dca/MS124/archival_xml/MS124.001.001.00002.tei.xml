But a lot us, I didn't live too far from the Capitol Theatre, so I used to go there more than some of the others. The Broadway Theatre and the Capitol Theatre were the two that were the closest. And then the Peterson's Orpheum which was on Cross Street, uh near McGrath highway, was another place. We used to go there on Saturday afternoons because they'd have horror pictures, gorilla pictures, everything else. What they'd do is give you candy bars, you'd see serials, news and everything else.

And a lot of times I'd go on Saturday nights in the earlier days when I was still in junior high with my mother and father, we'd go to the theatre. They'd take us down the theatre; there was no such thing as taking a car.  We'd walked from Pearl Street to Broadway, which was only about five-minute walk at the most. And had no problems. There was never any problems, we were out. We went say, the movie started at seven-thirty, we were home by ten o'clock. And on Saturday nights they used to have a give away night.</u>

Putting out a picture, keeping the building, they were expensive buildings to keep them. People were watching whatever came on TV, whether it was a movie or a play or something, so as a result, they went by the wayside. And the only time a lot of time people could go was at night, and they found that the price was another thing for a lot of people at the time; they couldn't afford the price of the tickets.

	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_214" n="214" end="timepoint_215">
	  <u who="EC">Like if you go to a mall and you go to a theatre, there's five or six different theatres there, and everyone has a, a show, that you don't know what the con-, you know, what the con-, the theme of the picture is, or anything else. You don't hear that much about them. There's, as I say, five or six different theatres in, within the confines of one building, and to try to find the one you want to go to, if you haven't read about it in the paper, you don't know where to go, you're just, just stymied there, you're looking at the bill board or something, and you don't know.

	  <u who="EC">Well, I, I think they miss out on the, the beauty of the theatres, I, as I say, the theatres today don't have the characteristics that they had in those days like you saw the, at the Central Theatre, the, the ah, uh, the ohhhh, how could I put it, the beauty of the architect inside, the beauty of the colors, and everything, they're not put together in the same manner as these theatres today.</u>

	<u rend="transcript_chunk" start="timepoint_223" n="223" end="timepoint_224">
	  <u who="EC">I think they missed out on the fact that the families could go together and be a family. That was the thing. Like today, the pictures that they were showing in their days, I wouldn't, to me they didn't have the interest that the old time pictures had, like, they used to, be with heroes, old time heroes and things like that. They don't bring in pictures today like that. Like Oklahoma, the old stoge, stage plays, they don't make pictures like Benny Goodman story, the Glenn Miller story, different things like that which was part of history, they don't have them today. Today pictures to me don't have the rhyme, the theme, or don't have a story to tell. Very few of them do. So, and as a result in those days, the pictures used to have a, you could relate to part of the history right there. SoI don't know, to me, I used to enjoy them, because they told you something about, oh an individual or a, a group, family, like during the war, there were a lot of pictures like Hirojima, and things like that, so I guess something that was happening. So, but today, they don't have as much--along with the humor, there was a lot of humor in pictures in those days, so and that kept you, that kept you, interested. Yeah.</u>

	  <u who="EC">Yes, they do. Because they go out, today they buy a lot of these, or they rent a lot of movies, so you, those, in our day, there was nothing like that.
